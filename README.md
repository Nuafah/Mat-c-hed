## This project is a Two-player competitive game in matching 15 pairs of cards and there is a single-player mode that races against time with a scoreboard system.

Rules:
1. Starts with 30 cards faced-down 

2. Player starts opening 2 pairs of cards if they match 
score +=??? (according to card difficulty and time bonus) to the player and continue to open another pair and repeat until the cards donâ€™t match.

3. Another player starts to open the cards and repeats steps 2-3

4. The first player who reaches a score of 8 wins the game.

note: There are timers of 10 seconds counting down between each player's turn if the timer runs out the turn skips.
